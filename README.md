# CDOForceKeyboardLayout

Ever needed to implement a 'Force Keyboard Layout' feature for your OSX application? Look no further!

This small library will handle saving the user's desired keyboard layout, as well as KVC-support so
you can bind the available layouts to a `NSPopUpButton`

Please note that this is my first attempt at a library. Comments and criticisms very much appreciated!

Only tested on 10.8.
